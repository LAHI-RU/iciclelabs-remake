# Icicle Labs - Modern React Website

This project is a complete, modern refactor of the original Icicle Labs website. It was rebuilt from the ground up using React (with TypeScript) and styled with the latest Tailwind CSS v4.

The original HTML, CSS, and JS were converted into a fully responsive, component-based React application.
